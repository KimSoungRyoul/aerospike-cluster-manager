"""Read-only asinfo verb whitelist for ``ACM_MCP_ACCESS_PROFILE=read_only``.

The Aerospike asinfo protocol multiplexes both reads (``namespaces``,
``version``, ``roster:``, ...) and writes (``set-config:``, ``recluster:``,
``truncate-namespace:``) over the same wire format. The MCP read-only
profile therefore cannot decide a tool's safety from its name alone — it
needs to inspect the *verb* (the leading token of the command).

This module is the single source of truth for that decision. It lives at
the package root so the service layer can import it without reaching back
into ``mcp/``. The service raises :class:`InfoVerbNotAllowed`. The MCP
error mapper at :mod:`mcp.errors` translates it to ``code=invalid_argument``
so the LLM sees a "pick a different verb" signal rather than a permission
denial.

To add a verb:

1. Verify in the Aerospike CE 8.1 docs that the verb is purely read-only
   and triggers no persistent state change (no log dump, no metric
   counter mutation beyond standard read paths).
2. Add it to :data:`READ_ONLY_INFO_VERBS` below in the matching category.
3. Add a unit test in ``tests/test_info_verbs.py`` so future drift is caught.
4. Update the literal-equality pin in
   ``tests/test_info_verbs.py::test_whitelist_membership_is_pinned`` —
   that pin exists so silent ADDITIONS are caught at review time, not
   just silent removals.
